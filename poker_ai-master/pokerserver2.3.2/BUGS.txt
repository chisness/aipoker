KNOWN BUGS/TODO:

7:Extend RemoteMachine to Windows

To make RemoteMachine work for Linux, quotes were removed
from around ssh '<commands>'
They will probably have to be put back in on a Windows
machine.

11: close AlienClient without logging out.

This does not cause a TimeoutException, so the session keeps running, leaving machines
on the server. Maybe after a day they would be wiped. Should be tested.

12: Synchronization error in AlienNode.internalLoad (with machineWarrant).

NOTE:Has not occurred since maz put in the print statements to locate the place
where the error had occurred.

16: (Alien) Client does not receive error message correctly if match has unknown bot.



FIXED BUGS:
1:Need to cleanly exit from Forge.runTournament()

LocalMachine.clean() was not terminating all StreamConnect
threads because some of them were not added to loose threads.

At present, running localprofile.prf on steele-lk would generate
this bug if it re-occurred.

2:Need to be able to interface to a PA bot with a java command line.
Handled by RemoteMachine and LocalMachine.

4:Need to fix RemoteMachine

RemoteMachine had issues because Linux did not respond well
to single quotes surrounding the arguments: in fact, they
appeared unnecessary.

8:Implement ringseat.Permutation,ringseat.RingPolicy

9:Implement tournament.RingSeries

10:Implement e-mailing of results in alien.

An alternative to the current technique would be to
simply maintain a list of the started matches locally,
and when they are all completed, e-mail them to the client.
At present, the "meaning" of various alien bots and machines
does not make much sense. Moreover, if an alien machine
CRASHES it can take a very long time for the matches to terminate
releasing the lock.

5:Add NoLimit server

Instead, RingServer handles no-limit

6:Add Ring server
RingServer handles ring and no-limit games

3:Suppress javadoc errors in compileWithMeerkat.bat.

This was partially handled by adding meerkat-docs, but meerkat-docs
needs to be added to the release.

13: Create results file on timeout from PokerServer.

Doublecheck to make sure that this is done. Might be related to Error 12.
This works fine now.

14: Handle "timeouts" on startup.

Perhaps the easiest way is to just declare the match a draw on a startup timeout.

15: Handle NullPointerException if match is cancelled externally.

ca.ualberta.cs.poker.free.server.TimeoutException: Player timed out:0:receive
ca.ualberta.cs.poker.free.server.TimeoutException: Player timed out:0:send
