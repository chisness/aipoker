WE want kevin to: 

WIN WIN WIN HAHAHAHAHHAHA

The best way to go, is to make Kevin always bet if he has an ACE

Always fold if he has a Jack

Bet with 2/3 probability if he has a King 
Bet with 1/3 probability if he has a Queen 


And then implement the appropriate calling and checking for when you can't bet. 

Use the BLUFFER as a reference.
