3-player Kuhn Poker agent

Team Members: Dale Keith, Krista Shuckerow

Team Name: Kevin the Rubber Duck

## How to Run

To run the project, execute the startme.sh script located in the root directory. The startme.sh script takes in two parameters: the server address and the port.

``` startme.sh addr port ```

The script executes the python file ``` connect_to_dealer.py ```, which connects to ```dealer.c ``` from the project_acpc_server directory (``` project_acpc_server/dealer.c ```).

## Why Kevin
Kevin is the name of my rubber duck.

Whenever I get stuck on python, Kevin is always there to help, which is why Kevin made such a great AI bot. Considering it's written in python, we want Kevin to act humanly and rationally to be able to beat anyone in his favorite game, 3-player Kuhn Poker.
